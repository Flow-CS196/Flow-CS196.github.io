CS 196 Project - Flow

About Flow

  Flow spawned from a project we created for CS 196 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Flow creates easy to follow, logical "flow" charts for novice developers. Simply drag and connect different types of syntax to create a useable JavaScript file. Files are saved locally to save a project for later use or editing. 

Different Types of Syntax

START - The start shape signals the first block of a new file and cannot be deleted. When writing a new file, connect your second statement to the start parallelogram. 

SIMPLE - The simple rectangle creates a block of code for statements just as "{}" would in JavaScript. 

CONDITIONAL - The conditional diamond creates a conditional statement inside the file. 

INPUT - The input oval allows the user to enter any input that can be evaluated by the eval() function. For example, entering the string "k = 7;" creates a new variable "k" containg the double "7" in Javascript. 

Saving and Loading

  Saving will save the Flow file locally to your computer. Use the load button to retrieve that file for editing or use later. 
  
Things You Shouldn't Do

  Do not use the "$" as a variable or the keyword "this" in your file.
