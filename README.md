CS 196 Project - Flow

About Flow

  Flow spawned from a project we created for CS 196 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Flow creates easy to follow, logical "flow" charts for novice developers. Simply drag and connect different types of syntax to create a useable JavaScript file. Files are saved locally to save a project for later use or editing. 

Different Types of Syntax

START - The start shape signals the first block of a new file and cannot be deleted. When writing a new file, connect your second statement to the start parallelogram. 

SIMPLE - The simple shape creates a block of code for statements just as "{}" would in JavaScript.
